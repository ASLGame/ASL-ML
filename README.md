# ASL-ML
ML model responsible for detecting ASL letters. 

File Descriptions:
  - Model/ -> Used the .h5 file of our trained model to predict the ASL alphabet. You just need to run parallel_keypoint_classifier.py for testing out the model. 
  - Dual_Dataset_Creation -> Creates full image dataset that will be used for the keypoint dataset
  - landmark_dataset_creation -> Analyzes each image in the Obj_dataset/data and logs their keypoints into a csv file
